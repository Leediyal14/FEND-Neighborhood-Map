## Neighborhood Map Project

   Project 7 for **Google - Udacity FEND Nanodegree Scholarship** Program.


#### Project Overview

   * A single page application featuring a map of our neighborhood or a neighborhood we would like to visit. 
   
   * Added functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.
   
   * This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


#### How to run this App?

   * Clone or download this repository to your local computer. If downloaded, unzip the folder.

   * At terminal, check that if you have Node.js installed. If installed, then move to the new cloned directory by using `cd` command.

   * From inside that new directory, run the following command to install dependencies `npm install`

   * And after that, start the server with the `npm start` command in terminal.

   * The Neighborhood Map App will automatically open in the browser and you can run manually from [click here](http://localhost:3000/) too.


#### Available Scripts

    In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

##### `npm install`

   * Install all the node dependencies

##### `npm start`

   * Runs the app in the development mode

##### `npm run build`

   * Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

   * The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Now the app is ready to be deployed!

   * See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
